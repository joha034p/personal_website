            My name is Johan Santaolalla Rives Larsen. I am a 23 year old guy, who is naturally creative and always have a lot of ideas in my head. I like to express my creativity through art and creation. <br />
            <br />
            When I want to make my ideas become reality, I strive to complete the challenges I give myself, aswell as think about how to make them even better.
            <br />
            I also love traveling and discovering new countries and cultures.

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>
              When I first started this study, I had never tried coding before. But coding has always been an interest of mine, so to finally learn how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is something I really appreciate.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over the course of this study so far, I've gained knowledge and understanding of how those three languages work together, and what great potential they have.
              <br />
              <br />
              I find it fascinating, knowing that the opportunities through coding are limitless and that everything is possible.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              Designing all kinds of things has always been a great interest of mine. When I was little I wanted to design buildings and cars. As I grew up a bit, designing clothing really caught my interest. Now, designing websites is something I
              really enjoy doing.
              <br />
              <br />
              I get alot of ideas all the time, and I find it satisfying to put those ideas into reality. That's why I love the combination of coding and designing - because you get to see the result of your work immediately.

            <h3>Concept Development</h3>
            <p>
              Developing concepts is something we've dived into here at the study. I've gained knowledge about the whole process of coming up with new concept ideas, and how to execute them.
              <br />
              <br />
              Creation of suiting content regarding the concept, is also something we've worked alot with, and an area where my idea thinking comes in handy.

            Throughout my study as a Multimedia Designer, I've already made alot of different types of work. Everything from content creation to design to advanced coding. And more.

            Down below you can see some examples of the work I've done.

                  The main goal of the 'T-Shirt Website' project was to come up with a concept and a matching USP (Unique Selling Proposition), to sell T-Shirts. Besides from that, I also put together a prototype of the regarding website. My idea was
                  to donate money to charity for every purchase.
