            My name is Johan Santaolalla Rives Larsen. I am a 23 year old guy, who is naturally creative and always have a lot of ideas in my head. I like to express my creativity through art and creation. <br />

            When I want to make my ideas become reality, I strive to complete the challenges I give myself, aswell as think about how to make them even better.
            <br />

            I live in Kongens Lyngby in a small apartment with my girlfriend. We've been together for almost 7 years, and still going strong. In december 2020 we got a dog, which we named Theo. He is a spanish waterdog, who we love with all our
            hearts.

            I am an upcoming Multimedia Designer, who loves the whole process of designing and creating websites. The thing I like the most about creating websites, is the combination of coding and designing, and the feeling I get when I overcome any
            challenges.
