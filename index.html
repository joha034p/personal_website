              My name is Johan Santaolalla Rives Larsen. I am a 23 year old guy, who is naturally creative and always have a lot of ideas in my head. I like to express my creativity through art and creation. <br />
              <br />
              When I want to make my ideas become reality, I strive to complete the challenges I give myself, aswell as think about how to make them even better.
              <br />
              I also love traveling and discovering new countries and cultures.

              I live in Kongens Lyngby in a small apartment with my girlfriend. We've been together for almost 7 years, and still going p. In december 2020 we got a dog, which we named Theo. He is a spanish waterdog, who we love with all our hearts.

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>
              When I first started this study, I had never tried coding before. But coding has always been an interest of mine, so to finally learn how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is something I really appreciate.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over the course of this study so far, I've gained knowledge and understanding of how those three languages work together, and what great potential they have.
              <br />
              <br />
              I find it fascinating, knowing that the opportunities through coding are limitless and that everything is possible.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              Designing all kinds of things has always been a great interest of mine. When I was little I wanted to design buildings and cars. As I grew up a bit, designing clothing really caught my interest. Now, designing websites is something I
              really enjoy doing.
              <br />
              <br />
              I get alot of ideas all the time, and I find it satisfying to put those ideas into reality. That's why I love the combination of coding and designing - because you get to see the result of your work immediately.

            <h3>Concept Development</h3>
            <p>
              Developing concepts is something we've dived into here at the study. I've gained knowledge about the whole process of coming up with new concept ideas, and how to execute them.
              <br />
              <br />
              Creation of suiting content regarding the concept, is also something we've worked alot with, and an area where my idea thinking comes in handy.

            Throughout my study as a Multimedia Designer, I've already made alot of different types of work. Everything from content creation to design to advanced coding. And more.

                  For this project, the focus was to combine copy- and micro copywriting with different UI conventions. My assignment was to create a unique concept and website prototype for a fictive T-Shirt company. This project tought me alot
                  about how different conventions affects the user experience of a digital product.
                  <br />
                  As a result to this project I created a website prototype called "MONO".

                  The project was to redesign a existing website, for the takeaway company "Morrow". Since Morrow had an existing app, they wanted their website to reflect the same energy and looks as the app.
                  <br />
                  The website was created through WordPress, and has alot of user friendly interactivity.

                  This project's main goal was to redesign Radio LOUD's website, so that it became more user friendly. The job was to make it young and fresh, fitting to the target group. Another focus point was to make the site interactive, through
                  sorting and filtering.
                  <br />
                  The website is created through WordPress, which helped me gain a better understanding of how WordPress works.

                  The main goal for this project was to create content for a company. My group and I created video content for the coffee shop "vores kaffebar".
                  <br />
                  One of my main responsibilities was to edit the video which introduces the coffee shop.
